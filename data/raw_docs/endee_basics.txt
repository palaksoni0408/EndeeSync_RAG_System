Endee is a high-performance vector database designed for semantic similarity search. It provides a simple yet powerful API for storing and querying vector embeddings at scale.

KEY FEATURES

1. Fast Similarity Search
Endee uses the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search. This enables sub-millisecond query latency even with millions of vectors.

2. Flexible Index Types
- Dense Indexes: Pure semantic search with vector embeddings
- Hybrid Indexes: Combine dense vectors with sparse vectors for improved retrieval

3. Multiple Distance Metrics
- Cosine Similarity: Best for normalized embeddings
- L2 Distance: Euclidean distance in vector space
- Inner Product: For unnormalized vectors

4. Quantization Options
Choose the right balance between accuracy and storage:
- BINARY: Maximum compression
- INT8D: Default, good balance
- INT16D: Higher precision
- FLOAT16: Near-full precision
- FLOAT32: Maximum accuracy

5. Metadata and Filtering
Store arbitrary metadata with each vector and filter results using:
- $eq: Exact match
- $in: Match any in list
- $range: Numeric range [0-999]

GETTING STARTED

Installation is simple with Docker:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Or build from source on Linux/macOS with CPU-optimized flags (AVX2, AVX512, NEON).

The dashboard runs on localhost:8080 for visual management and monitoring.

PYTHON SDK

The Python client makes it easy to integrate Endee into your applications:

1. Create an index with specified dimension and distance metric
2. Upsert vectors with metadata in batches up to 1000
3. Query with top-k and quality parameter ef
4. Include filters to restrict results

ARCHITECTURE

Endee stores data in a configurable directory and uses memory-mapped files for efficient access. The HNSW graph structure enables logarithmic search complexity.

Index construction parameters M and ef_con control the graph connectivity and construction quality, affecting the accuracy/speed trade-off.

USE CASES

Endee powers a variety of AI applications:

- RAG Systems: Retrieve relevant context for language models
- Semantic Search: Find documents by meaning, not keywords
- Recommendation Engines: Suggest similar items
- Duplicate Detection: Identify near-duplicate content
- Clustering: Group similar items automatically

PERFORMANCE

On commodity hardware, Endee can handle:
- Millions of vectors in a single index
- Thousands of queries per second
- Sub-10ms query latency (p95)
- Efficient batch ingestion

The actual performance depends on vector dimension, index parameters, and hardware specifications.

BEST PRACTICES

1. Choose dimension based on your embedding model (common: 384, 768, 1536)
2. Use INT8D precision for most applications (balances accuracy and speed)
3. Set M=16 and ef_con=128 for general use; increase for higher accuracy
4. Normalize vectors when using cosine similarity
5. Batch upserts for faster ingestion
6. Monitor index statistics via the dashboard

AUTHENTICATION

By default, Endee runs without authentication for development. For production, set the NDD_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable and provide the same token in API requests.

PERSISTENCE

All data is stored in the configured data directory and persists across restarts. Regular backups are recommended using standard filesystem backup tools.

SCALING

For horizontal scaling, consider:
- Sharding by metadata categories
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Caching frequently queried vectors
- Using hybrid indexes for better recall

MONITORING

The dashboard provides real-time metrics:
- Index size and vector count
- Query latency percentiles
- Memory usage
- Request throughput

LIMITATIONS

Current version limitations:
- Maximum dimension: 10,000
- Maximum top-k: 512
- Maximum ef: 1024
- Range filter values: [0-999]
- Max batch size: 1000 vectors

These limits balance performance with practical use cases.
